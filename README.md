# SubStrings

Implement a method #substrings that takes a word as the first argument and then an array of valid substrings (your dictionary) as the second argument. It should return a hash listing each substring (case insensitive) that was found in the original string and how many times it was found.

Pseudocode:

#Convert word/sentence to array

#Convert substring in dictionary to array -> nested array

#Compare substring array with word array if letters matches

#If match, count number of times substring matches word/sentence

#Create hash to store the substring and count
